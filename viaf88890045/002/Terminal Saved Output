LESSON XVI

MASCULINE NOUNS OF THE A-DECLENSION. REFLEXIVE
PRONOUNS

dyarnges Tov TAnCioy Gov ds TuvTdV.
Thou shalt love thy neighbor us thyself 

87. Masculine Nouns of the A-declension. Most nouns
of the a-declension are feminine. Masculines may be
recognized not merely as referring to males but also as show-
ing -ys or -as instead of -y or -a in the nominative singular.
Their genitive singular ends in -oy. Otherwise the inflec-
tion parallels that of the feminines.

oTpatiotys soldier Bevias Xenias
OTparist ns OTPATLOT aL Bevi Gs
OTpATLUOT ov oTpatint av Eevi ov
OTpatuait y OTpaTiiT ais Bevig
aTpariwt qv oTpatidt as Bev av

Note the two indications of masculine gender in -; of the nomina-

tive singular and -ou of the genitive singular, both of which occur in}

the o-declension.

In like manner inflect éxAfrqs.

88. Reflexive Pronouns are formed from the stems of the
personal pronouns and the proper case forms of adtés. In
